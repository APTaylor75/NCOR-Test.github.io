        <h2>About NCOR</h2>
        <p>The National Center for Ontological Research (NCOR) was established in Buffalo in 2005 with the goal of advancing the quality of ontological research and development and of establishing tools and measures for ontology evaluation and quality assurance. NCOR draws on the expertise of ontologists associated with the University at Buffalo and of their collaborators in scientific, commercial and government institutions throughout the world.</p>

        <h2>What is Ontology?</h2>
        <p>Contemporary ontology is a partnership of multiple disciplines. On the one hand ontological research involves philosophers who are concerned to describe broad categories of entities and their most basic relationships. On the other hand ontologists are working in diverse fields of computer and information science to provide more narrowly focused classification systems in areas such as bioinformatics, engineering, or defense and security.</p>
